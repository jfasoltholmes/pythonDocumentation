          Introduction
        </header>
        <p>
          Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is used for: 
          <ul>
            <li>web development (server-side)</li>
            <li>software development</li>
            <li>mathematics</li>
            <li>system scripting.</li>
          </ul>
          Why Python?
          <ul>
            <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
            <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
            <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
            <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.</li>
          </ul>

          Syntax
        </header>
        <p>
          Python was designed to for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
          Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
          Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
          The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              if 5 > 2:
                print("Five is greater than two!")
              if 5 > 2:
                    print("Five is greater than two!")
            </code>
          </pre>
          You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example-incorrect" class="python">
              if 5 > 2:
                print("Five is greater than two!")
                      print("Five is greater than two!")
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Comments
        </header>
        <p>
          Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
          Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              # This is a comment
              print("Hello, World!")
            </code>
          </pre>
          Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              print("Hello, World!") # This is a comment
            </code>
          </pre>
          Python doesn't really have a syntax for multi-line comments, but you can use a multiline string instead of multiple #'s:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              """
              This is a comment
              written in
              more than just one line
              """
              print("Hello, World!")
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Variables
        </header>
        <p>
          Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.
          Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the following code creates two variables, x and y, and assigns values to them:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              x = 5
              y = "Hello, World!"
              print(x)
              print(y)
            </code>
          </pre>
          Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Conditionals" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Conditionals
        </header>
        <p>
          Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
          <ul>
            <li>Equals: a == b</li>
            <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
            <li>Less than: a < b</li>
            <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
            <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
            <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
          </ul>
          These conditions can be used in a variety of ways but, they are most commonly used in "if statements" and loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an if statement could be used to only print a message if the condition is True:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              a = 33
              b = 200
              if b > a:
                print("b is greater than a")
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>

      <section id="Booleans" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Booleans
        </header>
        <p>
          In programming you often need to know if an expression is <code id="intext-code-example">True</code> or <code id="intext-code-example">False</code>.
          You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, <code id="intext-code-example">True</code> or <code id="intext-code-example">False</code>.
          When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer.
          The <code id="intext-code-example">bool()</code> function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost any value is evaluated to <code id="intext-code-example">True</code> if it has some sort of content.
          Any string is <code id="intext-code-example">True</code>, except empty strings. Any number is <code id="intext-code-example">True</code> Any number is <code id="intext-code-example">True</code>, except 0. 
          Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are <code id="intext-code-example">True</code>, except empty ones.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="For_Loops" class="main-section">
        <header>
          For Loops
        </header>
        <p>
          A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
          This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
          With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the following code prints all the items in the list named fruits:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
              for x in fruits:
                print(x)
            </code>
          </pre>
          Even strings are iterable objects considering they are similar to an array of chars:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              for x in "banana":
                print(x)
            </code>
          </pre>
          The <code id="intext-code-example">break</code> statement can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items, this is important for all types of loops:
          <pre>
            <code id="code-example" class="python">
              fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
              for x in fruits:
                print(x)
                if x == "banana":
                  break
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
